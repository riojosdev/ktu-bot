# Using Github Automatic Deploy to Heroku.
1. Create a new Heroku Dyno.
2. Select **NodeJS Buildpack** & search for **NodeJS-Puppeteer Buildpack** from the created Dyno's settings tab.
3. Install postgress database **addon**.
4. Add the following **config vars**
    * `CRON_INTERVAL` -> Use CRON time format
    * `DATABASE_URL` -> This is provided by default when postgres heroku addon is added.
    * `JOB_NAME` -> The value used here is `bot` (without quotes). Anything else will break the app.
    * `KTU_URL` -> Use the official KTU website announcements page URL.
    * `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID` -> After running the `start.js` file you will get the Telegram group id. Copy that here.
    * `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` -> Token provided for the Telegram bot by Telegram's Botfather.

    In the heroku website dashboard, in the Overview tab there is a section called Dyno Formation. Make sure the `worker node index.js` is set to ON. And `web npm start` is set to OFF.
5. Download the main repo from github & change all the `process.env.NAME` with the appropriate values in quotes.
6. **IMPORTANT: Run `node start.js` locally for the first time.** See the steps for **Installation / Use (LOCALLY)** (see below)
7. Copy the Chat Id from the console output. Add it to the config vars for the `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID`
7. Now delete the `start.js` file from the github. Press . in the repo and right click on `start.js` and select Delete Permanently. From the source control add all changes using the `+` button and type in a commit message then finally press `CTRL+ENTER`.
8. In your heroku Dyno dashboard in the Deploy tab select `Connect with Github`, give access to your Github account & then search and select the KTU-TEST repo. Then Finally Enable Automatic Deployments.

# Installation / Use (LOCALLY)
1. Install Node.js & NPM.
2. Run `npm install` from the directory.
3. Reconfigure with user's environment variables on `start.js`.
    **Environment Variable Reference**
    ```javascript
    // Telegram Bot Token
    const bot = new Telegraf('1234567890:AA3hgDT53kiy768GT6Fcvh7o923dVFU091a');
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Heroku Postgres Database URL 
    const cn = {
        connectionString: 'postgres://hdslkjfsjfuklj:fkahdflkksjdfjdid3ufd392udohdkjh32hrrk3hjrh32kjhrh32rh43hrjhj34h@ec2-000-00-000-00.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5432/dajkhaslhdlashd',
        ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    // KTU Website URL for the announcements page 
    await page.goto('https://ktu.edu.in/eu/core/announcements.htm', { waitUntil: 'load', timeout: 0 });
    ```
4. Run `node start.js` in the console while in the directory. It should sent a telegram message and create a wordpress post for the latest MBA annoucement on the group where `/start` command was passed.
   Note: The bot should be in the group/channel to recognize the `/start` command.
5. Copy the **chat id** that was outputted in the console. While running `node start.js`.
